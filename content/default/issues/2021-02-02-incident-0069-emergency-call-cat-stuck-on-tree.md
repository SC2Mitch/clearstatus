An Engine was dispatched to the ULSA Campus to assist with a cat stuck atop of the tree. Firefighters quickly went to work once they arrived and climbed up the tree and assisted the cat with getting off of the tree. Once done, the firefighters identified that the cat was in need of veterinary attention and was taken to the vet by our firefighters.
